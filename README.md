## **Electrical Engineer**

I'm a German Electrical Engineer and like doing projects on the side to my daily work. My Projects generally have some kind of hard- and software component, but I like trying out new stuff like 3d printing or the design and manufacturing of PCBs. The quality of my projects varies from designing a PCB with multiple iterations to stuffing a prototype into a box and don't touch it anymore. Generally, the latter is also my approach to coding, but until now I have finished every project.


Most of the projects were done in my free time. Therefore, the documentation in the code is a mixture of German and English. Some projects have a dedicated documentation in pdf form. I did those as a practical assignment for my university courses. The documentation therefore is in German.
