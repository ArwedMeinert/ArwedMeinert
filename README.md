**'Electrical Engineer'**

I'm a German Electrical Engineer and like doing projects on the side to my daily work. My Projects generally have some kind of hard- and software component, but I like trying out new stuff like 3d printing or the design and manufacturing of PCBs. The quality of my projects varies between designing a PCB with multiple iterations and stuffing a prototype into a box and don't touch it anymore. Generally, the latter is also my approach to coding, but until now I have finished every project.
